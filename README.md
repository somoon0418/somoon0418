## 🧠 What I can (probably) do

- Write `console.log("hello world")` like a pro  
- Break things with JavaScript... then fix them (maybe)
- Use React to make buttons that look pretty and sometimes even work
- Talk to APIs like they’re old friends  
- Fight with CSS and lose gracefully  
- Git commit like: `feat: tried something. not sure if it works. YOLO`
- Build stuff with Next.js because... why not?
- Copy-paste from Stack Overflow with *style*
- Python? Yeah, I know a bit. Mostly used for yelling at files and scripts.
- Can explain movie plots better than I can explain my code

## 📬 Contact?

I'm probably buried under a pile of books,  
lost in a movie universe,  
or crying over a missing semicolon somewhere...

But if you *must* reach me (brave soul),  
you can try sending a carrier pigeon...  
Just kidding 😜
